# AndroidKeyLogger
Does something straight forward, logs everything you type on your phone. Saves it locally on your phone itself. No hazzle no dazzle :)


Build and install the app (Will attach link to binary shortly).

TurnOn Settings>Accessibility>AndroidKeyLogger (Services section)

Close and open the app again.
