# AndroidKeyLogger
Does something straight forward, logs everything you type on your phone. Saves it locally on your phone itself. No hazzle no dazzle :)


Build the app manually with AndroidStudio or get it here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aCfpDIt9npF0bODJQDsHtVS2wi84xJzU/view?usp=sharing.

Install the app.

TurnOn Settings>Accessibility>AndroidKeyLogger (Services section)

Close and open the app again to see the typed text contents.

Its a work in progress, so all suggestions and pull requests are welcome :)
